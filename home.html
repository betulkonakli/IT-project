				Originally known as BackRub, Google is a search engine
 that started development in 1996 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a research project 
at Stanford University to find files on the Internet. Larry and Sergey later decided the
name of their search engine needed to change and decide upon Google, which is inspired from
 theterm googol.

				The domain google.com was later registered on September 15,
 1997, and the company incorporated on September 4, 1998. The picture below is a capture o<br>
 the site from The Internet Archive of what Google looked like in 1998.

<p>What helps Google stand out from its competition and helps it continue to grow and be the number one search engine is its PageRank technique that sorts search results. While being one of the best search engines on the Internet, Google also incorporates many of its other services, such as Google Maps and Google Local, to provide more relevant search results.</p>
<p>Google's roots go back to 1995 when two graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, met at Stanford University. In 1996, Brin and Page collaborated on a research project that was to eventually become the Google search engine. BackRub, as it was called then (because of its analysis of back links), stirred up interest in the university research community, but didn't garner any offers from the major portal vendors. Those were early days in terms of mass searching of the Internet; one of the CEOs who turned them away said that users don't really care about search abilities. Undaunted, the founders scrounged up enough funding to get started, and in September of 1998 began operations from a garage-based office in Menlo Park, California. In December of that same year, PC Magazine listed Google as one of its Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines for 1998.

Google was chosen for its resemblance to the word googol -- a number consisting of a numeral one followed by a hundred zeroes -- as a reference to the vast amount of information in the world. Google's self-stated mission: "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
